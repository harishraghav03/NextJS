Next.js is built on top of React.
As React is a library, Next.js comes with its own router.

It comes with a compiler for transforming and minifying JavaScript code.
CLI - For building and starting apps.
Node.js Runtime.

Front end is bundled and then executed in the browser.
Back end is executed inside the Node.js runtime.

This Node.js runtime also allows us to render the content on the server and then transfer the content to the client - SSR.

In this, we can pre-render certain pages that have static data when you build your application. 
We just render them once and serve them whenever they are needed - Static Site Generation.
