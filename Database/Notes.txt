Setting Up Prisma

1. Run the following command to initialize Prisma:
    npx prisma init

2. Format your Prisma schema using:
    npx prisma format

3. As we define and change our models, we need to create migrations. These migrations are used to keep our database schema in sync with the Prisma schema.
